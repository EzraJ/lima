# lima
A text-based game engine

lima's primary purpose(as of now) is a text-based game engine used in the Kajam gamejam(from repl)

The premise is very simple, we need to make a text-based game, and because(October 2nd) the gamejame starts later we'd like a game engine to work with. 

Right now this is very barebones and such, but most likely I won't touch this project after the gamejam unless it shows actual potential, or I use it for future gamejams/games.
I'll most likely just occasionally check on the project for bugs and fix them after the game jam. While working on it for the gamejam will be given a lot of attention. 

The project uses angelscript as the scripted language.
